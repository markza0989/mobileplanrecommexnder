# mobileplanrecommender
Mobile plan recommender is a terminal-based software that allows users to get their mobile plan recommended based on user input.
plan.json is a JSON file that contains mobile plan details, which a Python file will read and get data from.
SQLite will automatically be created after the user saves their current usage.
Please have the JSON and Python files in the same location when executing.  
Enjoy!
